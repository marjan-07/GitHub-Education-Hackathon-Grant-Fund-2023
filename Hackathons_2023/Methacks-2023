## Impact of GitHub Grant
Our team would not have been able to host our event without the help of the GitHub Grant. It was a big help since we had a sponsor pull out last minute and were tight on funding. Ultimately allowed us to support more hackers than we expected. Ultimately, we spent our grant money on snacks and drinks for our hackers Saturday afternoon.

## Top Projects

- We had tons of amazing projects at MetHacks, but we did need to narrow it down and select some top projects to award prizes to. Some of our favorite projects were;
